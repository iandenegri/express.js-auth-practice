# Ian's Venture Into Authentication with Express

## What I learned
- How to integrate a basic register, log in, and log out system to a website using local authentication rather than external auth via Twitter, Facebook, etc.
- How to write a basic authentication based middlewear.
- How to add middlewear to a page to check for authentication

## How to set up
1. Verify that node.js is installed and that your db has a connection open at localhost:27017
2. Navigate your terminal to the root of the directory that you installed the project to.
3. Install the requirements of package.json with `npm install`.
4. Run `node app.js`
5. Verify the project comes up at localhost:3000
